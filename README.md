# YouTube Bulk Upload UI - Lazy Edition

A simple tool for uploading multiple videos to your YouTube channel.

I needed something to help me upload my vacation videos and now I'm sharing it with you.

I also had the bad experience of paying for a similar application, which the developers then broke and then demanded I pay for the new version to continue using it. Hopefully this will help others avoid this kind of inconvenience.

## How to Use

Requires .NET 4.6.1. Download the latest release from here:

No installation needed. Start the application and you'll be prompted to provide access to your YouTube account in order to upload videos.

Afterwards, you can drag videos files to the main grid of the application and edit their details. When you're finished, just hit "Upload" and the app will do its job.

To remove videos from the grid, select the lines on the grid and hit "Delete".

Should work on MacOS or Linux with Mono.

## Planned Features

- Reading video EXIF tags to populate title and description automatically or with a pattern supplied by the user.

- Export / import lists of videos to upload in CSV file format (e.g. for compatibility with Excel).

- Resuming failed uploads.

## Privacy Policy

This app doesn't and will not gather ANY data from the user.

## Donations

If this tool helps you, consider sending a small donation to a charity of your choice and dropping me a line. You'll totally make my day. You can also donate a few bucks through me, in which case 100% of your donation will be forwarded to a children or animal shelter.
